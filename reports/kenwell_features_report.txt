CURRENT CAPABILITIES

AUTHENTICATION & ACCOUNT RECOVERY
- Email/password login with validation, password-visibility toggles, and busy states for async calls.
- Registration captures identity, contact, and credential data with shared input-formatters for cleaner data entry.
- Forgot-password screen confirms stored credentials and surfaces contextual SnackBar messaging.
- AuthService + AuthViewModel centralize SharedPreferences storage for Login, Register, Forgot Password, and Profile flows.

PROFILE MANAGEMENT
- Profile view reloads stored user metadata into editable text fields and validates every entry before save.
- Password confirmation enforcement with inline mismatch messaging.
- UI locks while saves are running and acknowledges success via SnackBars.

PLANNER & EVENT LIFECYCLE
- TableCalendar planner with calendar + monthly list tabs, grouped day cards, and add-event FAB.
- Comprehensive event form capturing venue, staffing counts, services requested, contact details, logistics, and timing.
- Gradient event cards with tap-through to EventDetails plus edit/delete actions and undo support.
- EventViewModel manages controllers, service selections, add/update/delete/restore helpers, and has unit tests for regressions.

NAVIGATION & THEMING SHELL
- Named AppRouter connects every auth, planner, settings, and wellness flow screen through a single switch.
- Bottom navigation exposes Planner, Profile, Settings, Stats, Help, and Conduct Event tabs inside an IndexedStack.
- ThemeProvider-backed light/dark mode toggle, notifications switch, and language selector in Settings.

WELLNESS DAY WORKFLOW
- Conduct Event tab orchestrates an 11-step workflow (consent, personal info, risk, screening, interventions, HIV/TB tests, survey).
- Each step owns a ChangeNotifier view model plus Kenwell-branded form components, validation, and navigation controls.
- Signature capture for consent and nurse interventions and contextual previous/next/cancel actions.
- Survey captures referral source, province, multi-question Likert ratings, and contact-consent before submission.

SUPPORT, REPORTING, AND UTILITIES
- Stats & Report screen logs event timing + throughput metrics ahead of report generation.
- Help & Support view surfaces version info, FAQ link, email shortcut, and T&C/Privacy links.
- Shared UI kit (form cards, buttons, checkbox groups, yes/no questions) plus reusable input-formatters and validators.
- Widget tests validate EventViewModel delete/update/restore scenarios.

RECOMMENDED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

SECURE, MULTI-USER AUTHENTICATION
- Migrate credentials away from plaintext SharedPreferences to a managed identity provider (e.g., Firebase Auth) with hashed storage.
- Add role-based access, MFA, and portable session refresh so multiple clinics/employers can authenticate safely.
- Connect forgot-password flow to transactional email/SMS services instead of local flag checks.

PERSISTENT EVENT & WORKFLOW DATA
- Back EventViewModel with SQLite/Firestore so planner entries persist across sessions and devices.
- Store complete wellness-flow submissions (including signatures) via repositories/APIs and expose participant history.
- Provide offline-first caching plus conflict resolution for teams operating without network coverage.

ANALYTICS, EXPORTS, AND DASHBOARDS
- Extend StatsReport to auto-ingest event data, compute KPIs, and export PDF/Excel bundles.
- Add charts for participation vs. expectation, screening completion, and referral outcome tracking.
- Automate employer- or scheme-facing recap emails after each wellness day.

NOTIFICATIONS & FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION
- Wire Settings toggles into actual local/push notifications for upcoming events, nurse follow-ups, and survey reminders.
- Alert teams when HIV/TB follow-up dates are overdue with deep links back into the relevant workflow step.

RICHER SUPPORT & KNOWLEDGE BASE
- Embed searchable FAQs, SOP PDFs, and contextual help snippets directly inside the Help experience.
- Offer live-chat or WhatsApp escalation plus per-screen "Need help?" affordances.

INTEGRATIONS & DATA GOVERNANCE
- Expose secure exports/APIs so medical schemes and employers can ingest screening data automatically.
- Add consent/audit logging, encryption at rest, and configurable data-retention windows for POPIA/GDPR compliance.
